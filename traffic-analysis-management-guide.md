# Rinova Traffic Analysis Management Guide

## Current status

The admin dashboard now includes a **Traffic & SEO** workspace. It intentionally shows setup status rather than invented traffic numbers. It explains what to connect, what to review weekly, and links to the external first-party tools.

The storefront already exposes browser-side event readiness for shop actions. Real visits, channel attribution, search queries, landing-page performance, engagement, and ecommerce reporting require a connected first-party analytics property or an approved data export.

## Recommended operating model

| Question | Primary source | What to review |
|---|---|---|
| Where are visitors coming from? | Google Analytics 4 Traffic acquisition | Sessions, active users, engaged sessions, engagement rate, key events and revenue by session channel. |
| How is Google Search performing? | Google Search Console Performance | Clicks, impressions, CTR, average position, queries, pages and countries. |
| Which landing pages help or hurt? | GA4 Pages and screens / Landing page | Landing sessions, engagement time, exits, key events and revenue by landing page. |
| Which products create demand? | GA4 Ecommerce reports plus shop order data | Item views, add-to-cart, checkout starts, purchases and item revenue. |
| How is the site being discovered? | Search Console plus sitemap reports | Index coverage, crawl issues, sitemap processing and page-level search trends. |

## Weekly workflow

First, compare the last 7 or 28 days with the previous period in GA4 Traffic acquisition. Separate organic, direct, social, referral and paid traffic. Next, use Search Console to identify pages or queries with falling clicks, impressions or CTR. Then compare product views, add-to-cart, checkout starts and completed orders so traffic quality is judged by commercial outcomes rather than visits alone. Finally, record one action for the next week, such as improving a high-impression/low-CTR page, refreshing a product description, or fixing a page with high traffic but weak add-to-cart rate.

## Data-source decision required before a real report

The traffic-analysis workflow must not invent or assume a source. For a real report, choose one of the following: your own GA4/Search Console CSV or XLSX export, Similarweb for overall traffic and channel/geography context, Ahrefs/Semrush/DataForSEO for organic keywords and top pages, or a combination. The current Similarweb connectors are disabled in the session configuration, so no Similarweb data was requested or used.

## Research references

Google’s GA4 documentation describes Traffic acquisition as the report for understanding where new and returning visitors come from, and its predefined reports include channel, engagement, event, page and ecommerce dimensions [1]. Google Search Console provides search traffic breakdowns by queries, pages and countries and recommends monitoring the Performance and indexing reports [2]. Google recommends hosting a root-level XML sitemap with fully qualified canonical URLs and submitting it through Search Console or referencing it from robots.txt [3].
